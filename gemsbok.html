                    <h3>GEMSBOK</h3>
                    <p></p>
                         <p>Gemsboks stand around 4 feet 7 inches at shoulder height and weigh between 230 – 250 kilograms (females weigh slightly less than males at around 200 – 210 kilograms).
                              Gemsboks coats are a light brown/grey colour with lighter patches to the bottom rear of their rump, and sandy grey flanks.
                               A dark stripe extends from their chin and travels down to the bottom of their neck, over their shoulder joints and leg along their lower flanks and on each side of their rear legs.
                              All four legs are black on their top half, with white below the knees and black patches on the shins.</p>
