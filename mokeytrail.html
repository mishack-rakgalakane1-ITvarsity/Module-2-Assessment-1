                        <h3>MONKEY TRAIL</h3>
                        <p>The Monkey Trail was introduced more recently and can be joined from the Dog at kit bag hill! (something to look forward to on the way back).  
                            Combined, the trail covers around 24km.  After crossing the railway track and the A449, take a sharp 
                            right where the signs can be clearly seen.  The Monkey is much more of an uphill slog than the Dog, however the 
                            technical stages are much more rewarding especially the two down hill sections at the end.  Plenty of airtime to be had 
                            depending on your skill levels and bravery.  By the way, the air ambulance can often be heard hovering about during the weekend. 
                            So next time you see someone shaking the collection tin remember it may be your taxi home one day!
                            Again, due to the soft ground and popularity, the Monkey trail is becoming less fun to ride compared to the fast flowing sections 
                            that were available when it first opened.  The exposed tree routes and 
                            polished stones will test out your riding skills. There is also a Black route with tight switchbacks and steep, rocky sections 
                            which is best ridden with a lowered seat, pads and a full face helmet are also recommended. Lowered tyre pressure will 
                            help with the grip on the more slippery parts; do take care of tyre pinch on the few rocky sections though.</p>
