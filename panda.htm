                    <h3>Panda</h3>
                    <p>The giant panda, also known as the panda bear, is a bear native to South Central China. 
                        It is characterised by its bold black-and-white coat and rotund body.
                         The name "giant panda" is sometimes used to distinguish it from the red panda, a neighboring musteloid.</p>
                         <p>The panda, with its distinctive black and white coat, is adored by the world and considered a national treasure in China.
                              This bear also has a special significance for WWF because it has been our logo since our founding in 1961.</p>

                           <p> Pandas live mainly in temperate forests high in the mountains of southwest China, where they subsist almost entirely on bamboo.
                                They must eat around 26 to 84 pounds of it every day, depending on what part of the bamboo they are eating.
                                 They use their enlarged wrist bones that function as opposable thumbs.</p>
                            
                           <p>A newborn panda is about the size of a stick of butter—about 1/900th the size of its mother—but females can grow up to about 200 pounds, 
                               while males can grow up to about 300 pounds as adults. These bears are excellent tree climbers despite their bulk.</p>
                       <p>Elephants are herbivorous and can be found in different habitats including
                        savannahs, forests, deserts and marshes. They prefer to stay near water.</p>
                       <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                        <p>You will find the Panda's at pen N12, right next to the Northern Frontier.</p>
