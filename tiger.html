                    <h3>Tiger</h3>
                    <p>The tiger is the largest living cat species and a member of the genus Panthera. 
                        It is most recognisable for its dark vertical stripes on orange-brown fur with a lighter underside. 
                        It is an apex predator, primarily preying on ungulates such as deer and wild boar</p>
                         <p>There are two recognized subspecies of tiger*: the continental (Panthera tigris tigris) and the Sunda (Panthera tigris sondaica).
                              The largest of all the Asian big cats, tigers rely primarily on sight and sound rather than smell for hunting. They typically hunt alone and stalk prey. 
                             A tiger can consume more than 80 pounds of meat at one time. On average, tigers give birth to two to four cubs every two years. 
                        If all the cubs in one litter die, a second litter may be produced within five months.</p>
                       <p>Tigers generally gain independence at around two years of age and attain sexual maturity at age three 
                           or four for females and four or five years for males. Juvenile mortality is high, however—about half of all cubs do not survive more than two years. 
                           Tigers have been known to reach up to 20 years of age in the wild.</p>
                          <p> Males of the larger subspecies, the continental tiger, may weigh up to 660 pounds. For males of the smaller subspecies—the Sunda tiger—the upper range
                        is at around 310 pounds. Within both subspecies, males are heavier than females.</p>
                       <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                        <p>You will find the Tiger at pen E26, at the Northern Frontier.</p>
