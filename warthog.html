                    <h3>Warthog</h3>
                    <p>The common warthog is a wild member of the pig family found in grassland, savanna, and woodland in sub-Saharan Africa.
                         In the past,
                         it was commonly treated as a subspecies of P. aethiopicus, but today that scientific name is restricted to the desert warthog of northern Kenya, Somalia, and eastern Ethiopia.</p>
                         <p>Researchers in the eastern Selous Game Reserve, Tanzania found the average lifespan of a warthog was 7 to 11 years. Other literature indicates that warthogs may live as long as 18 years.
                            When startled or threatened, warthogs can be surprisingly fast, running at speeds of up to 30 miles an hour. Warthogs are adaptable and are able to go long 
                            periods without water, as much as several months in the dry season.
                         </p>
                       <p>Global: The common warthog is widespread, often locally abundant, has a high reproductive rate, and is expanding its geographic range in South Africa.
                        The overall number of common warthog in South Africa is currently estimated to be at least 22,250.
                        Most populations seem to be in decline over much of the geographic range.
                        The Warthog may already be extinct in the Congo.</p>

                        <p>You will find the Warthog at pen W12, right next to the amphitheatre .</p>
