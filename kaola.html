                    <h3>Koala</h3>
                    <p>The koala or, inaccurately, koala bear, is an arboreal herbivorous marsupial native to Australia.
                         It is the only extant representative of the family Phascolarctidae and its closest living relatives are the wombats, 
                        which are members of the family Vombatidae</p>
                         <p>The koala is about 60 to 85 cm (24 to 33 inches) long and weighs up to 14 kg (31 pounds) in the southern part of its range (Victoria) but only about half that in subtropical Queensland to the north. Virtually tailless,
                              the body is stout and gray, with a pale yellow or cream-coloured chest and mottling on the rump. The broad face has a wide, rounded, leathery nose, small yellow eyes, and big fluffy ears. The feet are strong and clawed; the two inner digits of the front feet and the innermost digit of the hind feet are opposable for grasping. Because of the animalâ€™s superficial resemblance to a small bear, the koala is sometimes called, albeit erroneously, the koala bear.

                            The koala feeds very selectively on the leaves of certain eucalyptus trees. Generally solitary, individuals move within a home range of more than a dozen trees,
                             one of which is favoured over the others. If koalas become too numerous in a restricted area, they defoliate preferred food trees and
                              unable to subsist on even closely related species, decline rapidly. 
                              To aid in digesting as much as 1.3 kg (3 pounds) of leaves daily, the koala has an intestinal pouch (cecum) about 2 metres (7 feet) long, 
                              where symbiotic bacteria degrade the tannins and other toxic and complex substances abundant in eucalyptus. This diet is relatively poor in nutrients and 
                              provides the koala little spare energy, so the animal spends long hours simply sitting or sleeping in tree forks, exposed to the elements but insulated by thick fur. 
                            Although placid most of the time, koalas produce loud, hollow grunts.</p>
                       <p>The koala is the only member of the family Phascolarctidae. Unlike those of other arboreal marsupials,
                            its pouch opens rearward. Births are single, occurring after a gestation of 34 to 36 days.
                             The youngster (called a joey) first puts its head out of the pouch at about five months of age. </p>
                       <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                        <p>You will find the Kaola at pen E22, right next to the Giraffes.</p>
