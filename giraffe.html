                    <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>
                    <p>The giraffe is an African artiodactyl mammal, the tallest living terrestrial animal and the largest ruminant. 
                        It is traditionally considered to be one species, Giraffa camelopardalis, with nine subspecies.</p>
                         <p>Giraffe are highly social animals and live in herds of 15-20 female giraffe and some young males. 
                             Male calves will leave their mothers and the herd from around 15 months and join bachelor herds of other young males.
                              The female calves tend to stay with the same herd as their mothers but can leave after the age of around 18 months 
                              old, and most often stay in the same areas as the family herd they grew up in.</b>

                             Females are ready to mate from four years old and have a gestation period of 15 months – at birth, calves endure an incredible drop of 1.5m to the ground! Newborns weigh around 100kg and can be almost 2m tall at birth but their height will almost double within their first year. Newborns need to be so tall when they are born so they can reach up to suckle;
                             they are reliant on their mother’s milk for the first 9-12 months of life but will start eating leaves from 4 months old..</p>
                       <p><b>Neck:</b> One of the distinguishing characteristics of a giraffe is its long neck.
                            This allows giraffes to reach the highest leaves and shoots up in the Acacia tree (their favourite food source), 
                            which others browsers cannot reach, whilst also keeping an eye out for predators from their vantage point.
                            The neck is also used for ‘necking’ in Bulls. This is a ritualised fight that appears to help establish dominance,
                            and involves repeatedly swinging their neck to deliver head-butts to the other bull on their body and belly.
                            The giraffe’s neck has a very complex system that regulates their blood pressure,
                            ensuring that plenty of blood gets to their brain but not too much when they bend down to take a drink.</p>
                            <p><b>Horns:</b> Giraffes horns are actually known as ossicones and are found in both males and females, 
                                they are formed from ossified cartilage and covered in skin and hair.
                                 Both males and females are born with their ossicones but they lie flat at birth and are not attached to the skull in
                                  order to avoid injury to themselves and the mother, fusing to the skull as they grow older.
                                 Interestingly male giraffes often have thicker ossicones than females, which become bald on top due to frequent necking</p>
                       <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                        <p>You will find the Giraffes at pen E12, right next to the Kaola.</p>
