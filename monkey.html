                    <h3>Monkeys</h3>
                    <p>New World monkeys and the Old World monkeys, like the apes, have forward facing eyes, the faces of Old World monkeys and New World monkeys look very different,
                         though again, each group shares some features such as the shape of noses, cheeks and rumps.</p>
                    <p> Monkeys range in size from the Pygmy Marmoset, at 14 – 16 centimetres (5 – 6 inches) long (including their tail) and 120 – 140 grams (4 – 5 ounces) in weight,
                         to the male Mandrill which measures almost 1 metre (3 feet) in length and weighs 35 kilograms (75 pounds).
                          Some monkeys are arboreal (living in trees), some live on the savannah. Monkeys diets differ among the various species, however, they may contain any of the following: fruit, leaves, seeds, nuts, flowers, insects, spiders, eggs and small animals.</p>
                         <p>The Prosimian group is a sub-order of monkeys, very distinct from the anthropoids (sub-order anthropoidea, including monkeys, apes and humans). The prosimian category includes Lemurs, Lorises, and Tarsiers,
                              small creatures of the tropical forest who may most resemble our earliest ancestors.</p>
                       <p>Prosimians are restricted to tropical woodlands. Many surviving species have become nocturnal,
                            a habit that has been acquired because they have become withdrawn by competition from monkeys and rodents.</p>
                       <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                        <p>You will find the monkeys at pen E15, at the Monkey Trail.</p>
