                        <h3>INSECT-HOUSE</h3>
                        <p> insect house, is a manmade structure created to provide shelter for insects. 
                            Most consist of several different sections that provide insects with nesting facilities â€“ 
                            particularly during winter, offering shelter or refuge for many types of insects.</p>
                        <p>Rhino-Beetle</p>
                        <p>Rhinoceros beetles are herbivorous insects named for the horn-like projections on and around the males' heads.
                            Most are black, gray, or greenish in color, and some are covered in soft hairs. Another name given to some of these
                            insects is the Hercules beetle, because they possess a strength of Herculean proportion. Adults of some species can 
                            lift objects 850 times their weight. (That would be equivalent to a human lifting nine fully grown male elephants.)
                            One way the beetles use this extreme strength is to dig themselves into leaf litter and soil to escape danger. 
                            Their horns also help them to do this. 
                            Rhinoceros beetles can grow up to six inches (15 centimeters), making them some of the largest beetles in the world.</p>

                        <p>They can be found on the NW-08 entrance. </p>
